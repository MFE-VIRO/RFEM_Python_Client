    # In every test function run 'delete_all' first to clean up the model. It deletes mesh, results and all objects.
    # reset() on the other hand erases modification stack and all objects.
    # If you run reset() inside modification stack (from begin_modification to finish_modification),
    # all modifications will not take place.

    # Speed up the execution of the test.
    Model.clientModel.service.begin_modification()

    # Body of testing procedure

    # Every functionality needs to be tested only once.
    # Avoid extensive duplicating since it only adds to cost of maintaining tests.
    # DON'T USE Calculate_all function in unit tests. It works when executing tests
    # individualy but when running all of them it causes RFEM to stuck and generates
    # failures, which are hard to investigate.

    # Errors
    # To test various errors like ValueError, just put 'with pytest.raises(ValueError):'
    # before expression that should raise a ValueError.

    # COMMENTS
    # Broken object or type can by commented out assuming author will add
    # associated bug number so everybody else can understand and track the issue.
    # Also adding 'TODO' keyword is prudent practise.

    Model.clientModel.service.finish_modification()

    assert Model.clientModel is not None, "WARNING: clientModel is not initialized"
    #assert member.length == 5
    #assert member.result_beam_z_minus == 4

    # The only way to test corrrectness is by using ASSERTS.
    # Get the object that was set by test and verify its parameterts.
    # Asserts are well recieved by pytest and messages are reported to user.
    # Always test type specific parameters if possible.
    # If not, test some general ones like type or length.
    # Put all asserts after the finish_modification so it is more readable
    # and allows for clear distinction between setting values and checking them.

# No print("Ready") is necessary. Pytest doesn't print stdout to user if not specified or asserted.
# No return code is necessary. Pytest doesn't use it.

# !!!!
# Make sure that all changed global settings have been switched back before the end of the test.
# It could cause a mess in the results of tests that take place afterwards.

# BEFORE COMMIT:
    # - use formating (SHIFT + ALT + F) & linter (pylint UnitTests\template.py)
    # - clean up all unused/prototype code
    # - run all tests and examples to ensure everything works
